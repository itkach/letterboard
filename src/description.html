  Letter Board is designed to run on a large screen, such as TV or a
  large computer monitor. It comes with a companion application,
  Hand Board, designed to run on a handheld device such as mobile
  phone or a tablet.

<p>
  Begin by setting up the Letter Board: select font, adjust letter size
  as well as vertical and horizontal letter spacing so that letters
  take up the whole screen. Position yourself in front of the screen
  at a distance where letters are slightly blurred (or/and adjust
  letter size).
</p>

<p>
  Open Hand Board on a phone or a tablet: generate QR code for Hand
  Board matching current letter layout by tapping QR code icon
  <i class="fa fa-qrcode"></i> or type <span class="kbd-shortcut">q</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Scan QR code using a bar code scanner app. Alternatively, open
  generated Hand Board URL, copy it and send it to your handheld
  device via email or instant message. Open Hand Board URL in a
  browser.
</p>

<p>
  Tap play button <i class="fa fa-play"></i> to start the excersize.
  Look briefly at the two letters (large and small, same character)
  at the top of the Hand Board. Note which one is black (large or
  small) and find the same letter of matching size on the distant
  board. Then find corresponding location on the Hand Board and tap
  it to place the letter. If placed correctly, next letter
  will be displayed at the top. Continue until all letters are
  placed.
