    The excersize can be done with one eye at a time. Place an eye
    patch over the stronger eye first. After working with one eye,
    rest briefly by palming and sunning. Then work the other eye and
    rest again.

    Gradually you should be able to perform the excersizes with the
    Letter Board placed further and further away (or with smaller and smaller
    letters).  Take note of the distance (or letter size) each time
    you practice to keep track of your progress.
  </li>

  <li>
    Letter Board settings can be saved in named profiles. Select
    "New..." in profile dropdown list (left side of settings toolbar)
    and enter new profile name. New profile is created as a copy of
    current profile. Profile settings are saved automatically as you
    edit them.
  </li>

  <li>
    You can use color to help speed progress. Create several profiles
    with different backgrounds and slightly transparent black letters
    in addition to black letters on white background profile. From
    time to time, do the drill using colored background profile first,
    then repeat with white background profile.
